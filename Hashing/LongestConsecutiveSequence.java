/*
This solution uses hashmap to find the longest consecutive sequence.
To find if an element is the starting point of a consecutive sequence: if arr[i]-1 is not present in the hashmap, itâ€™ll be the starting point.
[1] populate the map with arr elements and value as false.
[2] start traversing the array while checking if arr[i] is the starting element.
If it is, keep finding its successors, while marking them as true. Once they are all found, input their length in the given variable.
[3] if the successors are not found, or if no more successors are found then the next element of the array is checked- if it is the starting point or not.
If it is, the entire process is repeated. If it is not, the next element in the array is checked.
